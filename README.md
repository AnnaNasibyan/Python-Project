## Python-Project

The objective of this project is to explore regional differences in media coverage of high-profile mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals between the United States and Europe from 2015 to 2020. I hypothesized that Europe would be far more focused on the potential monopolsitic effects as well as regulatory issues, while the US would emphasize the competitive advantage of the deals, and on the benefits to the shareholders, emphasizing the different cultures. I did this by analyzing keywords, bigram co-occurrences, and topic modeling, and later was able to identify some thematic focuses in media narratives across the two regions. While it is not a very clear difference, I would say that the media in the US prioritized the transactional and financial aspects, with frequently used terms like "deal," "billion," and "judgment," reflecting an emphasis on legal processes and competition. In contrast, European media emphasized technical and regulatory themes, with dominant keywords such as "compressor," "commission," and "turbo," highlighting industrial impacts and market implications. Network analysis revealed clusters of legal and competitive terms in U.S. articles, while European articles showcased industrial and policy-related themes. This suggest that regional media narratives reflect to a ceertain extent local economic priorities and regulatory environments. However, the analysis is limited by the reliance on English-language sources and a significant representation of UK-based articles within the European dataset.
