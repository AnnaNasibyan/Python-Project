## Introduction 

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are very important events that have the potential to shape global markets, influence corporate strategies, and force regulators to act. The media plays a crucial role in framing these deals, they do so by influencing public perception and what this project hinges upon is that the media also reflects regional economic and regulatory priorities. This project examines the regional differences in media coverage of high-profile M&A deals between the United States and Europe, focusing on how narratives vary across these two massive and very active M&A markets. 
The public policy rationale for doing this project stems from the need to understand how and to what extent regional media perspectives align with local priorities. With globalization driving cross-border M&A deals, these insights can be important tools for analysis for policymakers and they can be crucial for corporate strategists navigating the distinct regulatory and public environments in the U.S. and Europe.
This study contributes to understanding regional narratives by systematically analysing media language and themes. I have hypothesised that U.S. media focuses on competitive advantages and shareholder value, reflecting the countryâ€™s business-centric culture, while European media emphasizes regulatory hurdles and industrial impacts, consistent with stricter oversight and policy-driven priorities.
